@article{AccuratePositi,
	abstract = {The development of a fast, accurate, and inexpensive position-controlled pneumatic actuator that may be applied to a variety of practical positioning applications is described. A novel pulsewidth modulation (PWM) valve pulsing algorithm allows on/off solenoid valves to be used in place of costly servo valves, The open-loop characteristic is shown both theoretically and experimentally to be near symmetrical, A comparison of the open-and closed-loop responses of standard PWM techniques and that of the novel PWM technique shows that there has been a significant improvement in the control. A linear process model is obtained from experimental data using system identification. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller with added friction compensation and position feedforward is successfully implemented, A worst case steady-state accuracy of 0.21 mm is achieved with a rise time of 180 ms for step inputs from 0.11 to 64 mm, Following errors to 64-mm S-curve profiles were less than 2.0 mm, The controller is robust to a sixfold increase in the system mass. The actuator's overall performance is comparable to that achieved by other researchers using servo valves.},

@article{ModelsPneumati,
	abstract = {PWM (Pulse width modulated) solenoid valves possess the advantages of low cost, high flow rate gain, and simple structure. However, the use of a PWM solenoid valve causes both discontinuity and nonlinearity of the flow rate; this results in difficulties of modeling and of control. This paper presents our work on modelling a pneumatic PWM solenoid valve for engineering applications. Two models are presented. one is the instantaneous mass flow rate model which can be used in the simulation to study the dynamic behavior of pneumatic PWM control systems, another model is the equivalent mass flow rate model which is developed for facilitating the synthesis of pneumatic PWM servomechanisms. An equation for determining the maximum operating modulation ratio of the PWM solenoid valve is also presented. Simulated results using the established models are compared with the experimental results for both the static characteristics of a PWM solenoid valve and the dynamic behavior of a system composed of a PWM solenoid valve and a constant volume chamber.},
