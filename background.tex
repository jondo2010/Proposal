\section{Background}

The Formula SAE vehicle is a performance car built with the primary goal of doing well in the dynamic events at the yearly competitions. These events test the vehicles' abilities in acceleration, braking, and handling.

\subsection{Existing Electrical Systems}

The vehicle as a whole is primarily a mechanical device, but carries several critical electronic control systems.

\subsubsection{ECU}

\nomenclature{ICE}{Internal Combustion Engine}
\nomenclature{ECU}{Engine Control Unit}

The \emph{Internal Combustion Engine} (ICE), a Honda CBR600 F4i, is controlled by an off-the-shelf S80Pro \emph{Engine Control Unit} (ECU) from DTAFast \cite{s60pro}, which controls fuel injection and spark timing signals to the fuel injectors and coils. A feedback path to the ECU from a wide-band oxygen sensor downstream of the combustion chamber allows the controller to sense the amount of residual oxygen in the exhaust, and allows closed-loop control of the combustion process. The ECU also reads several tempurature, pressure, and rotational velocity sensors from the engine.

\subsubsection{DAQ}
\nomenclature{DAQ}{Data Aquisition device, provides and logs high-performance GPS, accelerometer, and ADC input data}
\nomenclature{GPS}{Global Positioning System}

The \emph{Data Aquisition Device} (DAQ) is an off-the-shelf model DL1 from Race Technology \cite{DL1Dsheet}. The DL1 is an expandable data logger with built-in 20-Hz GPS and 3-axis accelerometer. Race Technology provides a software suite that communicates with the DAQ using a documented serial protocol. Every item that the DAQ logs is output in its own channel in real time on the serial line. It is also possible to configure the software to recognize new channels for arbitrary types of data.
