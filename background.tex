\section{Background}


The Formula SAE vehicle is a performance car built with the primary goal of
doing well in the dynamic events at the yearly competitions. These events test
the vehicles abilities in acceleration, braking, and handling.

The vehicle as a whole is primarily a mechanical device, but
carries several critical electronic control systems. The \emph{Internal
Combustion Engine} (ICE\nomenclature{ICE}{Internal Combustion Engine}),
a Honda CBR600 F4i, is controlled by an off-the-shelf S80Pro \emph{Engine
Control Unit} (ECU) from DTAFast\cite{s60pro}, which
controls\nomenclature{ECU}{Engine Control Unit}
fuel injection and spark timing signals to the fuel injectors and
coils. A feedback path to the ECU from a wide-band oxygen sensor downstream
of the combustion chamber allows the controller to sense the amount
of residual oxygen in the exhaust, and allows closed-loop control of
the combustion process. The ECU also reads several tempurature, pressure,
and rotational velocity sensors from the engine.
